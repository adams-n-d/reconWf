These codes will run a simple test with:
* Atmospheric layers:  1
* Frames:             10
* Lowrese Size:       64-by-64

Start by trying to compile and run this code.  You'll need to edit
the first line of the makefile, so that you can use the Trilinos
include files.

If it compiles, then try to run it, using, say:

  mpirun -np 1 MyLSQR

or 

  mpirun -np 4 MyLSQR

Configuration for number of frames and problem size reside a macros in script.hpp
